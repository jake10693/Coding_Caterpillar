## Description

The Coding Caterpillar is my own spin on the GUI version of a childrens toy that already exists. It is essentially a game that will help teach children the process behind computer programming. The game essentially should work by creating directional buttons on the screen that when clicked, will save it's value and post a small log on the screen showing the order of directional buttons they have pressed so far. There will then be an execute button which will causes the virtual caterpillar to move accross the screen in the order of the directional buttons initally pressed and logged. Ideally, the game will consist of levels of incrementing difficulty. The goal of each level will be to navigate around the obstacles presented in a maze format on the screen to reach a specified goal destination.
